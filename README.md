# Exercise-Log-With-Database
Daily Exercise Log Tracker
 - for logging weight / strength training exercises over time
 - exercise data: string id, string exercise name, double weight (lb / kg), int sets, int reps, int difficulty, bool completed
 - using XAMPP - Apache Server, data stored in MySQL, PHP PDO database access

## Future Enhancements
- Upgrade from localhost to secure host provider and export database
- Allow for user to change date with navigation buttons and see different days and exercise lists
- Integrate calendar so user can choose a specific date
- Allow user to graph exercise data after a minimum amount of data is collected (weight / time, difficulty / time, one rep max / time)
