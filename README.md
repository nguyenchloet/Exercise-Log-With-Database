# Exercise-Log-With-Database
Daily Exercise Log Tracker
  <em>for logging weight / strength training exercises over time<em>

Exercise Data Saved in MySQL Database (XAMPP Server / PHP PDO) 

## Future Enhancements
- Upgrade from localhost to secure host provider and export database
- Allow for user to change date with navigation buttons and see different days and exercise lists
- Integrate Calendar so user can choose a specific date
- Allow user to graph exercise data after a minimum amount of data is collected (weight / time, difficulty / time, one rep max / time)
